# The Wonderful UI / Interaction Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to test and measure a Front End engineer's ability to interpret and implement a sample user interface that is detailed by a provided design. In this document, we will present you with a scenario that is intended to help showcase your engineering talents and spark creative thinking and problem solving. We will be watching both the journey and the final product.

## The Story
A well known brand is creating a landing page to showcase a proprietary dataset that the company as aggregated over years. This dataset is particularly vast and complex, and it requires various interactive visualizations to convey its meaning. Wonderful designers have mocked several visualizations that have been approved by the client, and these visualizations are now ready to be implemented. The plan is to implement these visualizations in a way that allows them to be agnostic of the platform or framework in which they ultimately will reside. Therefore, the request is to develop them with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

## Mocks
The mocks for the visualization in question are located at the following url:

## Expected Delivery
- a live URL to view your submission in action
- a reviewable copy of the codebase
- the ability to chat through your process and decisions

## Requirements
- Develop a front end module to match the provided mocks. The expectation is that users can interact with your work in a meaningful way, thus they should be able to utilize controls to interact with the data.
- Use your best judgement it pertains to animations, interactivity, and responsiveness.
- Match the mocks to the best of your ability.

## The Rules
- There is no time limit. You are done when you are satisfied - but the client is eager.
- The completed module must be written with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
- It is acceptable to use "fake" data.
- You can use any resource or library that you think is *best for the product*. However, you must be able to justify and attribute any external resource.
- You can ask as many questions you need to anybody at Wonderful. We have been working with this client for many years and can provide answers or feedback, or validate any assumptions.

## You will be graded on:
- the resilience, strategy, and organization of your codebase
- your knowledge of best practices
- your grasp of the CSS language
- semantic markup
- the elegance, efficiency, and performance of any javascript
- your understanding of best HTML practices
- your creative intuition as to how to "fill in the gaps" that are missing within the design
- your development speed, compared to the quality of the delivered product
- how easy it would be for another developer to hop into the project and work with you
- our understanding of the quality of your development process

âœ¨ Thanks! Good luck!
